# Version 3

Soo, I think it's time to start updating ( much more rewriting I guess ... ) this repo.

Please **Note** that this branch is in **WIP** status, and using it can lead to unpredictable problems.
The branch is under active development, and it contains breaking changes.
I'll provide full `changelog` with release.

## Milestone goals
- [x] Just update all dependencies and try to get all up and running as before
- [ ] Add `CHANGELOG`
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING and CONTRIBUTORS md files
- [ ] Fix reported bugs from issues
- [x] Rewrite / redesign module's `lib` part
- [x] Use bundler ( `Rollup` || `Webpack` ) for tree shaking and minimize bundle size
- [x] Write unit tests for nodes
- [ ] Code coverage 100%
- [ ] Add more clear documentation and provide examples with flows [#13](/../../issues/13)
- [ ] Provide full `CRUD` operations on the message sent by bot [#12](/../../issues/12)
- [ ] Add functionality to mention roles [#16](/../../issues/16)
- [ ] Create a backup branch with legacy version
